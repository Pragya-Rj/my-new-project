# Project Title

Final project for the Building AI course

## Summary

This project develops an AI system to optimize decision-making in airline mergers and acquisitions, leveraging data analytics to predict outcomes and maximize efficiency. Building AI course project.

## Background

M&A activities are crucial in the aviation sector, involving complex decisions with significant impacts. This AI solution addresses the need for advanced tools to analyze these decisions efficiently and accurately. Mergers and acquisitions are prevalent strategies in the aviation sector, with a global increase in activity over the past decade as airlines seek to leverage synergies, expand market presence, and boost operational efficiencies. The complexity and regularity of these transactions highlight the need for advanced tools to aid decision-makers. My interest in this project is driven by my  keen interest in aviation and finance background, where I've seen the variable success of M&A transactions. The limitations of traditional analytical tools in these high-stakes decisions inspire me to develop a more effective AI-supported solution. Successful M&A strategies are crucial as they can greatly boost an airlineâ€™s competitive edge and efficiency or, if mismanaged, lead to significant losses. The aviation industry's ever-changing regulatory and market conditions present a vital opportunity for applying AI to enhance decision-making, thereby aiding financial stability and industry growth.

This project is motivated by:
* The complexity and impact of M&A decisions in aviation.
* The potential of AI to enhance decision-making.
* The high frequency of M&A in this industry.

## How is it used?

The system is intended for use by airline executives, strategists, and financial analysts. It aids in:
1. Evaluating potential M&A opportunities.
2. Simulating outcomes of various merger scenarios.
3. Providing data-driven recommendations.

It is especially useful in strategic planning sessions and high-level decision-making meetings.

## Data sources and AI methods

Data is sourced from:
* Financial reports of airlines.
* Operational statistics from aviation authorities.
* Market share and competition analysis reports.

AI techniques employed include predictive modeling, machine learning for pattern recognition, and simulation of merger scenarios.

## Challenges

This project does not address: 
* Non-quantitative factors such as company culture and employee morale.
* Unpredictable market shifts post-implementation.
* Regulatory and legal approval processes.

## What next?

The project could expand to:
* Incorporate real-time data for dynamic scenario planning.
* Extend methodologies to other sectors with similar M&A activities.

Skills and assistance needed for advancement:
* Expertise in real-time data integration.
* Collaboration with industry specialists for broader applicability.
